# BeerCoin V2 Update Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The original BeerCoin system had a confusing registration flow where new users needed to already know a trusted user's address before registering. This created a chicken-and-egg problem and made onboarding difficult.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

**New Registration Flow (V2):**
1. New user creates a wallet
2. New user enters their username
3. QR code is generated for trusted users to scan
4. Trusted user scans QR code and approves registration
5. New user starts earning BEER tokens

This is much more intuitive and user-friendly!

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Smart Contracts (V2)

#### New Contracts Created:
- `BeerCoinV2.sol` - Updated token contract (same functionality)
- `BeerCoinDistributorV2.sol` - Updated distributor with new registration method

#### Key New Function:
```solidity
function registerUserByTrusted(address userAddress, string memory username) external onlyTrustedUser
```

This allows trusted users to register new users directly, which is exactly what was needed for the improved flow.

#### Backward Compatibility:
- Original `registerUser` function still available
- All existing functionality preserved
- Can migrate from V1 to V2 seamlessly

### Web Application Updates

#### Updated Components:
1. **Registration.jsx** - Now uses V2 contract service
2. **QRCodeScanner.jsx** - Updated to use `registerUserByTrusted` method
3. **contractServiceV2.js** - New service for V2 contracts

#### New Contract Service Features:
- `registerUserByTrusted(userAddress, username)` - New registration method
- Improved error handling
- Better transaction management

### Test Coverage

#### Comprehensive Tests Added:
- 22 test cases for BeerCoinDistributorV2
- Tests for new registration flow
- Tests for trusted user functionality
- Tests for backward compatibility
- All tests passing ✅
