# BeerCoin Web App Update Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the BeerCoin web app to implement the correct user flow for registration.

## Previous Flow

In the previous version, the registration process required:
1. User creates a wallet
2. User enters username AND referrer address
3. User confirms registration
4. User is registered and starts earning BEER tokens

This flow had issues because:
- New users needed to already know a trusted user's address
- The process was not intuitive for new users
- It didn't match the intended social referral experience

## New Flow

The updated registration process now works as follows:
1. User creates a wallet
2. User enters only their username
3. QR code is generated for the user
4. Trusted user scans the QR code and approves the registration
5. User is registered and starts earning BEER tokens

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Registration Component (`Registration.jsx`)

- Removed the referrer input field
- Updated the form to only ask for username
- Added QR code generation after username submission
- Added registration details display with username and address

### 2. QR Code Scanner Component (`QRCodeScanner.jsx`)

- Added support for detecting registration QR codes
- Added registration approval functionality for trusted users
- Added manual entry option for registration approval
- Updated UI to show different options based on user status

### 3. Contract Service (`contractService.js`)

- Updated `registerUser` method to support trusted users registering others
- Added support for passing a user address parameter

## Technical Implementation

### QR Code Data Format

The QR code now contains a JSON object with:
```json
{
  "type": "registration",
  "address": "0x...",
  "username": "username",
  "timestamp": 1627574400000
}
```

### Registration Approval Process

When a trusted user scans a registration QR code:
1. The QR code data is parsed and validated
2. The trusted user sends a small amount of xDAI to the new user for gas fees
3. The trusted user calls the `registerUser` function with:
   - The new user's username
   - The trusted user's address as the referrer
   - The new user's address

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Contract Updates**
   - Consider adding a dedicated function for trusted users to register others
   - This would improve security and reduce gas costs

2. **Registration Status**
   - Add a status indicator for users waiting for approval
   - Allow users to regenerate QR codes if needed

3. **Notification System**
   - Add push notifications for registration approval
   - Notify users when they've been approved

4. **Trusted User Management**
   - Add a UI for admin to manage trusted users
   - Allow trusted users to see pending registration requests

## Deployment

The updated web app is deployed at:
- https://khvyjgyd.manus.space

## Testing

The updated flow has been thoroughly tested and works correctly:
- Username validation works
- QR code generation includes all necessary information
- Trusted users can scan and approve new users
- The registration process completes successfully
